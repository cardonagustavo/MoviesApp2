## Dark and Light Mode Navigation
MoviesApp offers an optimized navigation experience for both dark mode and light mode. Navigation automatically adapts according to the preference setting of your device.

- **Dark Mode**: The app automatically switches to dark mode when the device is set to dark mode. This provides a smoother visual experience and reduces eye strain, especially in low-light environments.
